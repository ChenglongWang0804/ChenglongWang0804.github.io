        <dt>input tag</dt>
        <dd>  input tag is used to user input the data. Each input must have a label attached to it for accessibility.
            we add an id attribute to the input which matches with the for attribute of the label, to connect an input with the label tag.
            input tag has a type attribute to allow user input different information. There are many values for the type attribute,
            such as range,number,text,email,url,password,tel,date,clor,file. </dd>

        <dt>form tag</dt>
        <dd> used to collect information. 
            the two important atrributes we added to the form tag are <em>action</em> and <em>method.</em>
            action attribute is used to add the URL or file path as the destination of the form.
            method  attribute defines how the information is sent. There are two values used for this attribute. get and post.
            when the data is not secure like query strings in google, we use get value.
            when the data need to be hide for use,we use post, the post method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction.</dd>
