            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a student in Algonquin College. My passion is to assist others by programming.
                My job was to maintain financial system. If an issue or defect is encountered by my clients, I have to resolve it with my team as soon as possible.
                I have to learn financial and supply chain knowledge for communicating with my clients.
            </p>
               <p>
                In my spare time, I am interested in learning English and making wood crafts. 
                I also like doing fitness or playing basketball with my friends once a week.
               </p>
